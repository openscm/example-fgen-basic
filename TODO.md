- read through everything
    - check docstrings
    - check naming (if you want to propose a consistent naming convention, go for it)
- consider adding `m_error_v_w.build_instances` too, might be headache to pass arrays of things up and down correctly
- clean up
- final review (including deleting this file)
- merge
- move onto a basic result type with a subclass specifically for integers (`ResultInt` or something)
