## API docs

Our Python API is documented in [API][example_fgen_basic_1].
The Fortran API is documented in [Fortran API](./fortran-api/).
At present, the Fortran API docs are a sub-website so you can navigate to them
but there are no buttons to navigate back to the main docs page
(so you have to instead return yourself by re-entering the URL
or pressing back, sorry, we hope to improve this in future).
